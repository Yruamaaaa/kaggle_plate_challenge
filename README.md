# kaggle_plate_challenge
I built a deep learning pipeline using PyTorch to classify images of plates as clean or dirty for a kaggle Challenge. The core idea behind this project is to leverage transfer learning with ResNet and improve prediction accuracy through custom image preprocessing that emphasizes relevant visual features like stains, dirt, and surface clarity.
